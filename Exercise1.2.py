#Exercise 1.2.
#Q1.How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
#Ans.There are 60 seconds in a minute. So, 42 minutes is 42 * 60 = 2520 seconds. Adding the extra 42 seconds, we get 2520 + 42 = 2562 seconds.

#Q2.How many miles are there in 10 kilometers?
#Ans.Given that 1 mile is approximately 1.61 kilometers, we can convert kilometers to miles by dividing the number of kilometers by 1.61. So, 10 / 1.61 ≈ 6.21 miles.

#Q3.If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
#Ans.First, let’s convert the race distance to miles: 10 / 1.61 ≈ 6.21 miles.
#    Next, convert the race time to hours: 42 minutes 42 seconds = 42.7 minutes ≈ 0.712 hours.
#    The average pace is the total time divided by the distance, so 42.7 minutes / 6.21 miles ≈ 6.87 minutes per mile.
#    The average speed is the total distance divided by the time, so 6.21 miles / 0.712 hours ≈ 8.73 miles per hour.
#    So, there are 2562 seconds in 42 minutes 42 seconds, 10 kilometers is approximately 6.21 miles, and if you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, your average pace is approximately 6.87 minutes per mile and your average speed is approximately 8.73 miles per hour.
