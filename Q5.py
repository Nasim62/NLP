# Q5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
#Ans. If i have two values with no operator between them, Python will raise a SyntaxError. Python expects an operator between two values. 
#     Hereâ€™s an example:
print(5 5)
# Output: SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
